# PE 01 - Technobabble

## Overview
- For this assignment you will be building a mobile-friendly "Technobabble" generator, in 2 parts
- Note: we will be refactoring this in class, and your first HW assignment will be using this exercise as the starting point

<hr>

## I. Technobabble Part I.

- Here is the link to Part I of the assignment.
  - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-technobabble.md
  - Note that the video is using an iPhone Simulator to preview the mobile version of the site
  - You will most likely instead use Chrome's "Device Mode", which is under the developer tools, which you can *right-click and choose "Inspect"* to open. 
  - We should have demoed the use of "Device Mode" in-class, but in case we didn't, or if you forgot how to do it, check out these links below:
    - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/device-mode/
    - https://www.browserstack.com/guide/view-mobile-version-of-website-on-chrome
 - Watch the video linked from the page above, complete TB-1, and move on to TB-2

## II. Technobabble Part II.

- Here is the link to Part II.
  - https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/HW-technobabble-2.md
- Watch the video linked from the page above and complete TB-2
- Rename the HTML file to **technobabble-2.html** 

<hr>

## III. Finish it up & Submission

- You now have 3 files:
  - **technobabble-2.html** 
  - **src/main.js**
  - **styles/default-styles.css**
- Put these 3 files in a folder named **`<yourLastname>-<yourFirstInitial>-pe01`**
  - ex. A student named "Ace Coder" would name their file **coder-a-pe01**
  - test the app and be sure that everything still works!
- ZIP and POST the above folder to the myCourses dropbox
- DO NOT post these files to banjo
