## I. Get Started

- Copy your completed **wc-3** folder (and all the files in it) and name it ***lastName*-*firstInitial*-hw3**
- In the HTML page:
  - change the `<title>` and `<h1>` to "HW-3 - Link Buddy!" (or similar)
  - change the `<h2>` to "Save your links for later!" (or similar)
- In **main.js**:
  - comment out ALL of the existing code except for the "import MyBookmark" code that the top
  - stub in a `submitClicked()` arrow function  (NB - all your functions will be arrow functions) with a `console.log("submitClicked");` at the bottom
  - write code so that when the **Submit** button is clicked,  `submitClicked()` is called and a log is visible in the console
